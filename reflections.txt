How long did you spend working on this project?
Something like 2 or 3 hour split in 2 days

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Handle the error generated by some method (add_to_customer...). I really hate when my program just exit in the middle of the execution.

What two additional features did you build? Why?
1. Handle Error when occurs --> Like I said I hate a brutal exit of my program
2. A class method of Product stock_lower_than_or_equal this one can be call in order to know which product should be re-order. 

Where do you still have room to grow?
I think I can improve my documentation. And I maybe have some place that need refactoring, code always need to be refactor.
